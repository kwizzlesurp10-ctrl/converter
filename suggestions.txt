1. Morse Code Converter: Add a new tab for converting text to and from Morse code. This would be a classic and fun addition to the text transformation tools.
2. Binary Code Converter: Add a converter for text to and from binary (0s and 1s). This would appeal to a more technical audience.
3. Upside Down Text: A fun, stylistic conversion that flips text upside down.
4. Zalgo Text Generator: Create a "creepy" or "glitched" text effect by adding diacritical marks to the input text.
5. Markdown to HTML Converter: A more practical tool that allows users to write in Markdown and see the HTML output, which would be useful for developers.
6. Text-to-Speech: Integrate a text-to-speech engine to read the converted text aloud. This would improve accessibility and add a new dimension to the tool.
7. Shareable Links: Generate a unique URL for each conversion, so users can share their transformed text with others.
8. Themed Converters: Create special converters for holidays or events, like a "Christmas" theme that adds festive emojis or a "Halloween" theme with spooky characters.
9. Gamification: Add a "daily challenge" or a "conversion streak" to encourage user engagement.
10. Enhanced Customization: Allow users to not only create custom character mappings but also to create and save entire new converter "profiles" with their own rules and styles.
